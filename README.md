# Diabetes-Predictor

**Overview**
The Diabetes Predictor is a machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on patient health metrics. Using classification models, this project helps in assessing diabetes risk and contributes to preventive healthcare solutions.

*Features*
* Data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling, encoding)
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key trends
* Implementation of classification models
* Model evaluation using accuracy and other metrics

*Dataset*
The dataset includes health parameters such as:
* Glucose level
* BMI (Body Mass Index)
* Age
* Blood Pressure
* Insulin level
* Other relevant medical attributes

*Steps in the Project*
* Data Preprocessing: Cleaned the data, handled missing values, and performed feature scaling.
* Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualized distributions and relationships between features.
* Model Selection: Implemented classification models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
* Model Evaluation: Assessed performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* Predictions: Used the trained model to predict diabetes risk based on input parameters.

*Technologies Used*
* Python
* Pandas & NumPy (Data Preprocessing)
* Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)
* Scikit-learn (Machine Learning Models)

*Usage*
* Open Diabetes Predictor.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
* Run the notebook step by step to preprocess data, train models, and make predictions.
* Modify the input parameters to test different cases.

*Results*
* The model achieved high accuracy in predicting diabetes risk.
* Performance metrics were evaluated to ensure reliability.
